# Warp perspective

The program allows one to warp the image you require from the original image.
The coordinates of the image can be found out by uploading the image in  the paint and you can use the mouse pointer to find the cooridnates at the bottom left. Copy and paste the coordinates in the program to get the wrap output of your image.
